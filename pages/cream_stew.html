    <h3>Cream Stew - The secret world of Arrriety</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><em>While The Secret World of Arrietty didnâ€™t show a recipe for this dish on screen, many fans have surmised that it is a classic Japanese cream stew. Made with vegetables and a milk-based roux, this heart-warming stew is best served hot on a cold day. For an even heartier dish, you can add chicken or pork cubes.</em></p>
