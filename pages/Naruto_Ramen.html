    <h3>Ramen - Naruto</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><em>When I was big into Naruto, those hot steaming bowls of ramen seemed like the absolute perfect meal.  However, back then, I didn’t understand the difference between those, and what came out of Top Ramen packets.  Now, I’m still using the Top Ramen noodles, but I’ve added a lot more traditional ramen elements.  And even if the noodles and stock aren’t 110% authentic, it’s still delicious.  Believe it!

        (If you’re really looking for a from-scratch-as-traditional-as-you-can-get, I’m planning on making up that recipe a bit later.  Be forewarned, it’s a bit time consuming)</em></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Packages of Top Ramen</li>
            <li>About 5 cups of pork or beef broth (You can use the stuff in a box, the stuff in a can, or the cubes or the paste)</li>
            <li>Pork tenderloin</li>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Baby bok choy</li>
            <li>1 Green onion</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Optional:</li>
            <p></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Aburage - that’s those brown sticks on the right side of the bowl, it’s a type of soy product that’s used when you make inari-zushi.  It’s some of my favorite stuff, and you should be able to find it at an Asian food store.</em></li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li><em>Nori - I forgot to put this is mine, but it’s those black/green sheets sticking out of the back.  You’d probably be able to find this at any grocery store with an Asian foods section</em></li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li><em>amaboko - This is that white thing with the pink swirl.  Its made of a sort of fish paste that is steamed into like a cake.  I know it’s kind of distintive in the Naruto ramen, but I didn’t have time to go and grab some from an Asian food store (which is where you’d have to get it).</em></li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong><em>Instructions:</em></strong></p>
        <ol></ol>
            <li>Marinate the tenderloin for at least 3 hours.  You can use just soy sauce, or a mixure of whatever other Asian sauces you want.  Teriyaki would be good, as would some mirin.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 450, then cook the tenderloin for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked all the way through.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Put your eggs in a pot with enough water to cover them.  Bring to a boil and cover with a lid.  It should take about 10 minutes to hard boil the eggs.  Then pull them out and put them into a bowl of cold water to cool.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>While this is happening, pour or mix the stock/broth in a pot and bring it to a simmer.  You can add soy sauce or mirin to taste.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Once simmering, add the Top Ramen noodles.  Do NOT add in the flavor packets.  Let that cook.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Now, we cut up all the toppings!  Peel the eggs and slice them in half, cut the pork,  kamaboko, bok choy, aburage, and green onion into thin slices.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Serve up the noodles and broth in a nice deep bowl, then place all the ingredients in groups on top, and add in a few small rectangles of nori.  Itadakimasu!</li>
