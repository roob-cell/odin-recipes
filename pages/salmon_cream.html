    <h3>Salmon with cream sauce - Porco Rosso</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><em>Porco Rosso’s salmon dish doesn’t have an official name, but avid stans of Studio Ghibli have noted that it’s basically a salmon steak with cream-based gravy and baby carrots on the side. While the following recipe isn’t exact, the resulting dish does look very similar to the OG dish spotted in the anime film.</em></p>
